BlockCodingPuzzle
=================
Build a panel using 3”×1” and 4.5”×1" blocks. For structural integrity, the spaces between the blocks must not line up in adjacent rows. 
There are 2 ways in which to build a 7.5”×1” panel, 2 ways to build a 7.5”×2” panel, 4 ways to build a 12”×3” panel, and 7958 ways to build a 27”×5” panel. How many different ways are there to build a 48”×10” panel? The answer will fit in a 64-bit integer. Write a program to calculate the answer.
The program should be non-interactive and run as a single-line command which takes two command-line arguments, width and height, in that order. Given any width between 3 and 48 that is a multiple of 0.5, inclusive, and any height that is an integer between 1 and 10, inclusive, your program should calculate the number of valid ways there are to build a wall of those dimensions. 
Your program’s output should simply be the solution as a number, with no line-breaks or white spaces.
